  <p class="w3-justify">e-Golem.online is digital simulation-based textbook with interactive advanced
    animation for learning about human physiology.</p>
  <p class="w3-justify">
    Started more than 15 years ago we developed "Atlas of Physiology and Pathophysiology".
    This used animation in FLASH some of them integrated into interactivity and model computation.
  </p>
  <p class="w3-justify">We were working hard in technology which will allow to effectively create mathematical models and
  simultaneously export them as simulators available in PC and mobile devices. With recent
  development of various standards and tools it becames more easy and possible.
  And we have developed a technology called <b>bodylight.js</b> which introduces several
  tools and workflow to rapidly export mathematical model into web component, bind it to the charting or animation library
  and create web simulator without programming. See references technology description at <a class="w3-button w3-theme-d1" href="https://bodylight.physiome.cz">bodylight.physiome.cz</a></p>
