           question="K.2 At the age of 38, weighing 150 kg, conservative obesity treatment did not help, and in January 2016, the patient underwent sleeve gastrectomy. What mechanism is primarily targeted when performing sleeve gastrectomy in patients with morbid obesity, and how does it affect the pathophysiology of obesity?" 
           answers="A. Sleeve gastrectomy reduces the size of the stomach, decreases nutrient income and thus promotes weight loss. It also leads to a reduction in ghrelin levels, a hormone that stimulates hunger, resulting in a decrease in appetite.|B. The surgery increases insulin production by stimulating the pancreatic beta cells, which leads to better glycemic control and weight loss."

<bdl-quizx id="qik.4" type="choice" 
           question="K.4 Later that year (2018), she underwent a biliopancreatic diversion, which also excluded the duodenum and proximal part of the jejunum from the absorptive functional surface. In April 2020, she weighed 85 kg (BMI 27.5 kg/m2), losing from 140 kg (2018), i.e., a loss of 55 kg. However, she developed a secondary malabsorption syndrome. She was monitored by a surgeon, not a bariatrician, and later was completely without follow-up. She did not feel well, complained about constant fatigue, experienced hair loss, weakness, and inefficiency. Select all possible causes" 
           answers="A. Lack of vitamin B12, which can be caused by malabsorption due to surgical procedures on the stomach or small intestine, leading to fatigue, weakness, and in some cases, neurological problems.|B. Insufficient intake of biotin and zinc, which can lead to hair loss and dermatological problems. Biotin (vitamin B7) and zinc are important for the health of hair and skin.|C. Iron deficiency leading to anemia, which manifests as fatigue and weakness. Iron is key for the production of hemoglobin, which is essential for oxygen transport in the blood.|D. Deficiency of vitamin D and calcium, which can lead to bone weakening and increased risk of osteoporosis. Vitamin D and calcium are crucial for maintaining strong bone structure.|E. Lack of essential fatty acids, such as omega-3 and omega-6, which can lead to impaired brain and heart function, potentially contributing to feelings of fatigue and inefficiency."
