<bdl-quizx id="qik.5" type="choice2" 
question="K.5 The patient stated that after a long time he went on a trip to the mountains and took a cable car to the top. However, after getting off at the upper station, he became increasingly short of breath and this did not improve even after a few minutes of rest, so he returned down, where staff called an ambulance. In the past, he was treated for obesity and underwent several surgeries, one of which was the so-called sleeve gastrectomy. What is the primary mechanism targeted by sleeve gastrectomy?" 
answers="A. Sleeve gastrectomy reduces stomach size, accelerates the feeling of fullness, reducing nutrient intake and promoting weight loss. It also lowers ghrelin, a hunger-stimulating hormone, decreasing appetite.|B. The surgery increases insulin production by stimulating pancreatic beta cells, leading to better glycemic control and weight loss." 
correctoptions="true|false" 
explanations="yes|no" 
buttontitle="check answer"></bdl-quizx>

<bdl-quizx id="qik.6" type="choice2" 
question="K.6 Because the first surgery only helped temporarily, he underwent another one a year ago, the so-called biliopancreatic diversion, in which the duodenum and proximal jejunum are excluded from the absorptive surface. Today, his weight is 85 kg (BMI 27.5 kg/m²), and he is attempting moderate physical activity and hiking, which he had not done for years.<br/> All the options below are risks associated with biliopancreatic diversion. Select the one most likely related to the patient's current condition and shortness of breath." 
answers="A. Vitamin B12 deficiency, leading to fatigue, weakness, and sometimes neurological problems.|B. Insufficient intake of biotin and zinc, which can lead to hair loss and dermatological problems. Biotin (vitamin B7) and zinc are important for healthy hair and skin.|C. Iron deficiency leading to anemia, presenting as fatigue and weakness.|D. Vitamin D and calcium deficiency, which may lead to bone weakening and increased risk of osteoporosis. Vitamin D and calcium are essential for maintaining strong bone structure.|E. Deficiency of essential fatty acids like omega-3 and omega-6, which can impair brain and heart function, contributing to fatigue and low performance."

<bdl-quizx id="qik.7" type="choice2" 
question="K.7 Blood count and biochemistry results have arrived. Which explanation best describes the anemia?" 
answers="A. The findings are consistent with iron deficiency anemia, likely due to malabsorption.|B. The anemia is most likely caused by chronic inflammation, as suggested by mildly elevated CRP." 
correctoptions="true|false" 
explanations="Correct – low ferritin, microcytosis, and low transferrin saturation are consistent with iron deficiency.|Incorrect – mildly elevated CRP alone does not explain the anemia; in anemia of chronic disease, ferritin is usually normal or elevated."
