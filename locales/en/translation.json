 "about-text":"<p>We started more than 15 years ago. 'Atlas of Physiology and Pathophysiology' - powered by Adobe FLASH and some downloadable apps in .NET, MS Silverlight and other fancy technologies.</p> <p>Recent 5 years we developed missing pieces to convert Model to working web simulator. See details at <a class='w3-button w3-theme-d1' href='https://bodylight.physiome.cz'>bodylight.physiome.cz</a>.</p> <p>The research and development were funded by applied research grant mainly MÅ MT a MPO.</p><p> E-Golem is a startup project aiming to deliver professional digital textbook with simulators based on scientific knowledge either as a result from public funding or as a result of commercial support.
