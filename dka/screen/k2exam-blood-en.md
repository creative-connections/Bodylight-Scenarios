          question="Why does the patient have a normal hematocrit (0.42), but lower MCV in erythrocytes?" 
          answers="Due to hemoconcentration during osmotic diuresis combined with hyperosmolarity leading to a reduction in MCV of erythrocytes, manual recalculation of these values may also have an effect.|The dominant mechanism is the alteration of erythrocyte membranes during passage through the spleen, erythrocytes damaged by hyperosmolar environment and acidosis lose part of their membrane and reduce their surface area, however, they are not excessively destroyed, hence the hematocrit is normal."

           question="What is the reason for leukocytosis and what further examination would be appropriate to add?" 
           answers="For leukocytosis, I would add a differential leukocyte count and CRP. The analysis shows leukocytosis and an elevation of CRP to 58mg/L, predominantly in neutrophils, which is due to a suspected concurrent infection combined with a stress reaction, i.e., the release of neutrophils from bone marrow and spleen due to glucocorticoids.|The patient has a suspected concurrent hematological disease, leukemia or leukemized lymphoma cannot be ruled out, I will add flow cytometry examination from peripheral blood to exclude or confirm this possibility and plan a bone marrow biopsy."

<bdl-quizx id="q3" type="choice2" 
           question="Why does the patient have hyponatremia?" 
           answers="Primarily due to osmotic diuresis, generally dehydration and water loss should lead to hypernatremia rather than hyponatremia. In hyperglycemia, water shifts from the intra to the extracellular space, this water dilutes sodium contributing to hyponatremia, also due to ADH the excretion of water is reduced, further diluting sodium, another cause could be vomiting in some patients leading to sodium loss.|Dominantly, the patient experiences disruption of tubular functions due to dehydration and reduced diuresis, especially in the area of the proximal tubule, where most of the filtered sodium is absorbed. This disorder is also reflected by an increased fractional excretion of sodium. At the same time, due to the activation of stress response and the autonomic nervous system, the patient sweats significantly, which contributes to further sodium losses through sweat."

<bdl-quizx id="q4" type="choice2" 
           question="Why does the patient have hyperkalemia?" 
           answers="Lack of insulin in this complication leads to the production of ketones and acidosis, acidosis causes a shift of K+ out of cells, which is excreted relatively more than H+ due to the high acidity of the extracellular fluid, K+ is not sufficiently returned to the cells (in the kidneys, the reduction in K+ excretion is relatively significant to the severity of hyperkalemia). In long-standing complications of this type, there can also be proteocatabolism of muscle mass.|In the kidneys, potassium is actively exchanged for glucose by the tubules, thus the body tries to eliminate excessive amounts of glucose and reduce glycemia, which on the other hand leads to the retention of potassium, which the body subsequently uses to control ABR by exchanging it for H+ on the cell membrane."

<bdl-quizx id="q5" type="choice2" 
           question="Why does the patient have hyperglycemia?" 
           answers="It arises due to an absolute lack of insulin and overproduction of glucagon, which facilitates the entry of glucose into cells, this does not occur in the absolute absence of insulin. At the same time, gluconeogenesis occurs in the liver.|It arises as a result of excessive release of glucose from reserves in muscles and subcutaneous tissue during the activation of stress response, insulin deficit causes excessive intracellular retention of glucose, and the body in an attempt to increase extracellular glycemia to ensure sufficient supply to the CNS activates gluconeogenesis in muscles and subcutaneous tissue."
