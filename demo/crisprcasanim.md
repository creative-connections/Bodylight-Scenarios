This animation shows use of CRISPR/CAS method. Cas9 protein is enhanced with specific sgRNA targeting particular gene sequence. When Cas founds the target place it cuts the DNA and a novel gene is inserted into the target place. 
This is only one of the usage of CRISPR CAS method for genetic engineering.
