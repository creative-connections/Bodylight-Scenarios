# Structural information

Simulators can be enhanced by components with visualisation of macromolecular structure. 
The structural data are retrieved on demand from PDB database servers mantained by EMBL EBI and others in PDB consortium. The visualisation component used is based on Molstar viewer [^1] and PDBE component library [^2]. The structure is identified by 4 character PDB code (e.g. '2hhd' for human hemoglobin, '1m4e' for hepcidine)
