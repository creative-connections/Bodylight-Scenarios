# Creative Physiome

## Our goals

* Improve healthcare and medicine with simulators
* Based on plausible and scientifically verified mathematical models of human physiology and drugs
* Use standard technology stack (Modelica, FMU, WebAssembly, HTML, ...)
* No need of server or cloud - delivered as in-browser simulators
